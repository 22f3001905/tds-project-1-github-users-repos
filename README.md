# TDS: Project 1 - GitHub Users & Repositories

## Questions

1. An explanation of how you scraped the data
2. The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data
3. An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis

## Answers

1. Using the GitHub REST API with a token, I searched for users matching specific criteria, retrieved detailed user and repository data (up to 500 repos each), and implemented caching to avoid redundant requests.
2. In 2013, account creation peaked, declining since; 'Forth' has the highest median stars, repositories grew exponentially from 2012-16 but declined post-2023, and user 'david-gpu,' with only 3 public repos, holds the highest average stars per repo.
3. To increase visibility, developers should focus on quality, well-documented repositories, consider niche languages like 'Forth' for higher star ratings, and engage regularly with updates, community interactions, and popular repositories as GitHub creation declines post-2023.
